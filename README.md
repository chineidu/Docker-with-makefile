# Docker-with-makefile

This repo shows a simple template for using Docker with a Python app.

It also shows how to build Python packages locally.

## Build A Docker Image

```console
$ docker build -t <tag_name> -f Dockerfile .
```

## Run A Docker Image

```console
$ docker run -it [-p <port:port>] <tag_name>
```

## Generating distribution archives

These are archives that are uploaded to the Python Package Index and can be installed by pip.

Make sure you have the latest version of PyPAâ€™s build installed.

```console
# Mac/Linux
$ python3 -m pip install --upgrade build
```

```console
# Windows
$ py -m pip install --upgrade build
```

Now run this command from the same directory where **`pyproject.toml`** is located:

```console
# Mac/Linux
$ python3 -m build
```

```console
# Windows
$ py -m build
```

## Install The Package Locally

```console
$ pip install -e .
```
